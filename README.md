##Description:
> This project was made at first as an example to show students
how easy it would be to create a github account and then make a new repo.

##So now what?
> Well, this application started by me wishing I had a leet way of accessing 
awesome new updates on dribbble.com without being a member. I then 
realized that this idea could be abstracted and built into a total RSS feed
app that does __not__ suck like google feed reader.

* This still may be its own thing. Just sayin.
